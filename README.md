# Data Science as a Service
## Data Science as a Service: The Next Frontier in Analytics Evolution
## 2nd Nordic WiDS Conference - Inspiring and supporting women in data science, ML and AI

Organisations interest in adopting data as part of their strategy has been growing. It reached a point where its capability to support decision making while making sure they stay competitive has become undebatable. One well-known challenge in the adoption is linked to data literacy and use of data technologies as studies have reported that only ~21% feel confident regarding their data literacy skills (Qlik/Accenture 2019). In this talk it will be addressed how data science can assist businesses at integrating into their strategies by providing it as a service and what is the role of data science teams in this journey.
